# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

**This week**
- I worked on testing the application to ensure it was running locally
- I containerized the application by creating docker files for the front and back end
- I ran the docker files and confirmed that the application was working
- I also created the endpoint for notifications
- I installed and ran the DynamoDB & Postgres Containers
- I configured the gitpod.yml file with the database explorer for postgres
